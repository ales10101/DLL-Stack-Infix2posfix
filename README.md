# DLL-Stack-Infix2Postfix
This repository contains implementations of a Double Linked List, a stack, and an infix to postfix translation algorithm.

These programs were made as part of a project for an Algorithms class at Brno University of Technology, FIT.

# c202:
- Abstract Data Type (ADT) stack as a dynamic array.
- Stores char values.

# c204:
- Infix to postfix algorithm.
- Also contains an evaluation function for evaluating an infix expression.

# c206:
- Abstract Data Type (ADT) double linked list.
